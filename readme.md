This is my first project created to be pushed into a Git repository.

I've used the project to practice my HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS skills, as well as using it to learn how to use git.

It is a basic sign up form, that can be switched to a login form if needed. It reads input data from the new user, validates it and pushes it into a data structure.

It also takes input from the user to login and checks that against existing data, validates it and returns either a 'works well' message or error message
